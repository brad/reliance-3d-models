# Reliance Water Jug 3D Models

This project aims to provide a collection of 3D models related to Reliance water jugs. These models are designed to enhance or replace parts of your Reliance brand water jug, ensuring functionality and convenience.

## Current Models

### Air Hole Plug

The air hole plug is designed to fit perfectly into the air hole of a Reliance water jug, preventing leaks while allowing air to flow, ensuring a smooth pour. This model is ideal for those who have lost their original plug or are looking for a durable replacement.

## Getting Started

To use these models, you will need access to a 3D printer. The models are provided in STL format, which is compatible with most 3D printing software.

1. **Download the Model**: Choose the model you need and download the STL file.
2. **Prepare for Printing**: Load the STL file into your 3D printing software. You may need to adjust the orientation or scale depending on your specific needs and printer capabilities.
3. **Print**: Once you're happy with the setup, start the printing process. Make sure to use a material that is suitable for the intended use of the part.
